# Combined file

The combined files in this folder are made by the `build.sh` script to
facilitate easy copy-pasting to online Latex-to-PDF services like
[ScribTex](http://www.scribtex.com).

Simply copy the content of the combined file, paste it in a zero-setup
free account of ScribTex and hit the compile button.
