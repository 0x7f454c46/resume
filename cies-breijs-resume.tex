% Besides these packages nothing was needed to compile into pdf cleanly.

\subsection*{Summary}
\vspace{-1.2em}
\begin{multicols}{2}
Creative software engineer with roots in the open source (\textscale{.85}{FLOSS}) movement and a passion for user/customer centered software development.

At the age of 7 (1989) I wrote my first lines using a \textscale{.85}{LOGO}-like language on an \textscale{.85}{MSX} (pre-\textscale{.85}{PC}). Two years later I attended a conference on an emerging new technology, the Internet, at the Erasmus University from which I would graduate 16 years later.

After being introduced to the open source movement in 1997, I taught myself a variety of skills with help from the open source community. Since 2002 I am a contributor to the \textscale{.85}{KDE} project, as my pet project \textscale{.85}{KT}urtle got admitted into their \emph{edu} module.

\textscale{.85}{KT}urtle aims to make programming most easy and touchable. It is well suited for teaching (children) the basics of programming, math and geometry. Through this project I hope to give others the same opportunity I was given:\ to learn programming at early age.

From 2003 to 2007 I studied at the Erasmus University Rotterdam and graduated in \emph{Business and Computer Science} (one curriculum). In college I mainly focused on the economics of open source, rapid application development (\textscale{.85}{RAD}) and the semantic web technology stack (\textscale{.85}{RDF}/\textscale{.85}{RDFS}, \textscale{.85}{OWL} and \textscale{.85}{SPARQL}).

After university I traveled Europe and Asia during a 2 year sabbatical, I worked on several occasions (see experience below) and initiated an open source project (\href{http://www.truetopiaproject.org}{Truetopia}:\ a web application that facilitates self-governing online communities).

I am currently evaluating the plethora of interesting employment and business opportunities in \textscale{.85}{IT} while quietly working on a product to be released later this year.

  {Intellecap is a social-sector advisory firm serving corporates, non-profits, development agencies, and governments working in developing markets. Assessed their software development team and methodologies. Trained their developers and build several web applications, of which one is Mostfit:\ an open source \textscale{.85}{MIS} for \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit}{microcredit} lenders.

		{Dec '09 -- Jan '11}
  Zarafa might be the fastest growing open source product company in Europe. For an open source enthusiast like myself, working with Zarafa is a wonderful opportunity. Reporting directly to the \textscale{.85}{CEO}, Brian Josef, and working closely with the \textscale{.85}{CTO}, Steve Hardy, I drove the change to test automation and continuous integration. Furthermore I architected new documentation and translation systems. My Indian work experiences proved particularly valuable, as I was sent to analyze and streamline their outsourced operations in India.
