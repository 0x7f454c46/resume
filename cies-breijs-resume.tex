\begin{multicols}{2}
\noindent \emph{Creative software engineer with roots in the open source (\acr{FLOSS}) movement, an entrepreneurial mindset and a passion for user/customer centered software development.}
\\
\\
At the age of seven (1989) I wrote my first lines using a \acr{LOGO}-like language on an \acr{MSX} (pre-\acr{PC}).  Two years later I attended a conference on an emerging new technology, the Internet, at the Erasmus University from which I would graduate 16 years later.

After being introduced to the open source movement in 1997, I taught myself a variety of skills with help from the open source community.  Since 2002 I am a contributor to the \acr{KDE} project, as my pet project \KTurtle got admitted into their \emph{edu} module.

\KTurtle aims to make programming most easy and touchable.  It is well suited for teaching (children) the basics of programming, math and geometry. Through this project I hope to give others the same opportunity I was given:\ to learn programming at early age.

From 2003 to 2007 I studied at the Erasmus University Rotterdam and graduated in \emph{Business and Computer Science} (one curriculum).  After graduation I traveled Europe and Asia during a two year sabbatical, on which I worked on several occasions (see experience below) and initiated another open source project.  Most interesting was my work for Intellecap: I architected an implemented an adminitration systems for the booming micro credit lending industry.

Upon return from my travels I joined Zarafa, one of the largest open source software vendors in the Netherlands.  Two years later I was asked to join Intellecap as the \acr{CTO} of their software division (\acr{ISTPL}).
