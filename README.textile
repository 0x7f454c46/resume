h1. Resume of Cies Breijs

On Ubuntu I installed @texlive-latex-base@ and @tex-gyre@ before using @pdflatex@.
Besides these packages nothing was needed to compile it into PDF cleanly.

I cannot take much credit for the design, I found it on "toofishes' blog":http://www.toofishes.net
Though I changed a lot about it.

The result should be visible "here":https://github.com/cies/resume/raw/master/cies-breijs-resume.pdf


h2. TODO

 * get a picture in the upper right corner
 * cleanup the tex file: some repetitive stuff can move into functions
 * I did not see the lignatures work yet -- gimme lignatures!
 * get someone with a lot of experience to look at it
