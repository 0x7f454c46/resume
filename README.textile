h1. Resume of Cies Breijs

On Ubuntu I installed @texlive-xetex@ and @tex-gyre@ before using @xelatex@ to generate the @pdf@.

I cannot take much credit for the design, I found it on "toofishes' blog":http://www.toofishes.net
Though I changed it alot (it used @pdflatex@, I've moved it on to XeTeX for sexyier 'old style' numbers).

The result should be visible "here":https://github.com/cies/resume/raw/master/cies-breijs-resume.pdf ...


h2. TODO

 * get someone with a lot of experience to look at it


h2. TADA

 * ligatures (not very noticable with the gyre/pagella font, one could try libertine or hoefler)
 * old style numbers (had to make the apostrophes look nice on double-digit years)
 * cleanup the tex file: some repetitive stuff can move into functions


h2. WONTDO
